                <p>
                    Kadai Paneer is a bold, restaurant-favourite North Indian dish known for its thick, spicy
                    tomato-based gravy and crunchy bell peppers.
                    <br>The secret to its signature flavour is the Kadai
                    Masala, a freshly ground spice blend.
